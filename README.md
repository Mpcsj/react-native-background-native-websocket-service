# react-native-background-native-websocket-service
A simple project using React native for user interface and a native bridge with java code for creating a websocket background service
In this project, it's a very simple React native view that calls the Native Toast Module(following the official documentation from React Native). However, at Toast module, i'm calling a background service that handle a websocket service and send a message to the backend.

Ps: Do not forget to put your IP address at security_config.xml file to use the project
